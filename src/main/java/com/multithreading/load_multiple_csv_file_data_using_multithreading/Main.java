/**
 You are given a set of CSV files containing customer purchase records.
 Each file (purchases_part_1.csv, ..., purchases_part_5.csv) contains 100 rows of customer purchase data. The columns are as follows:

 TransactionID: Unique identifier for each transaction.

 CustomerID: Identifier for the customer.

 ProductID: Identifier for the product purchased.

 Quantity: Quantity of the product purchased.

 Price: Price per unit of the product.

 Your task is to create a multithreaded Java solution to first load data from
 the CSV files using multithreading to process each file concurrently.


 Then you'll need to aggregate data by customer.
 Calculate Total Revenue per Customer which is: Sum of (Quantity * Price) for each customer.
 Also calculate Unique Products Purchased per Customer.
